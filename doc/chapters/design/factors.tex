\section{Factors}\label{sec:factors}

We have identified the following factors that may affect the performance of the
system:
\begin{description}
	\item[Floorplan area] \ldots (needed? maybe just users density).
	\item[Floorplan X/Y ratio] \ldots.
	\item[Users density] \ldots.
	\item[Broadcast radius] \ldots (note: related to users density).
	\item[Hear window] \ldots.
	\item[Relay delay] \ldots.
	\item[Maximum copies] \ldots.
\end{description}

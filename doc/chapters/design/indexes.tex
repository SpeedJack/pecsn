\section{Performance indexes}\label{sec:indexes}

We have defined the following performance indexes:
\begin{description}
	\item[Total broadcast time] (\(t_B\)) \ldots.
	\item[Percentage of covered users] (\(\mathit{\%U}\)) \ldots.
	\item[Energy efficiency] (\(\mathit{Eff}\)) \ldots (TODO\@: we may
		define \(\mathit{Eff}\) as an index based on the broadcast
		radius (larger radius, more energy used) and the number of
		transmissions (\code{msgsPerSlot}) in the network (more
		transmission, more energy). This may be relevant since a network
		setup that broadcast a message in the same time of another setup
		using less energy is more efficient).
	\item[Total number of collisions] (\(C\)) \ldots (note: can not be used
		to compare scenarios with different numbers of users; at least,
		not without proper normalization).
\end{description}

\section{Model verification}\label{sec:verification}

To ensure that our implementation does not contains bug and correctly implements
the model we have performed various tests:
\begin{description}
	\item[Memory Check] We have used Valgrind on all tests defined in
		\code{tests.ini} to verify that there were no bad memory
		accesses and memory leaks.
	\item[Graphical Test] We have run the ``Simple'' configuration in the
		\omnetpp{} QT environment to check visually that the network
		works as expected. We have also collected statistics for these
		runs and checked that they are consistent with what we have seen
		in the graphical environment. This test has been also performed
		for the ``DocExample'' configuration, as shown in
		\figref{fig:snapshot}.
	\item[Step-by-Step Debug] We have also debugged the ``Simple''
		configuration step-by-step to check that our code takes the
		expected code path.
	\item[Event Trace Check] For the ``Simple'' configuration we have also
		logged and verified the event trace in order to ensure that
		events are scheduled in the correct order.
	\item[Deterministic Test] We have run the ``Deterministic''
		configuration in multiple repetitions and verified that the
		results were the same for all runs.
	\item[Continuity Test] \ldots.
	\item[Consistency Test] \ldots.
	\item[Degeneracy Test] \ldots.

\chapter{Model}\label{ch:model}

From the specifications described in \chref{ch:specs} we have defined the
following modules that compound the model:
\begin{description}
	\item[Floorplan] The \emph{network} representing the 2D floorplan and
		containing the users.
	\item[User] A \emph{submodule} representing a user in the system.
\end{description}

Additionally, to end the simulation when all reachable users have been infected
and to collect some statistics about the entire floorplan, we have added an
\standout{Oracle} module.

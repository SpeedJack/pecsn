\chapter{Position of starting node}\label{ch:starting-node}

In the analysis done in \chref{ch:analysis} we have ignored a factor that
influence the performance of the network: the position in the floorplan of the
user that sends out the first message (the ``starting user''). To understand why
this factor is important, see \figref{fig:startnodeexplain}. When the starting
user (the blue node) is in the center (\figref{subfig:startnodecenter}), the
message is sent radially in all the directions. In the general case, the ``area
of reachability'' is equal to \(\alpha\cdot\pi\cdot R^2\) where \(\alpha\) is a
constant that it is equal to \(1\) when the starting user is in the center;
\(\frac{1}{2}\) when the starting user is at the border
(\figref{subfig:startnodeborder}); \(\frac{1}{4}\) when the starting user is in
the corner (\figref{subfig:startnodecorner}). This may limit the capability of
the network to reach the full coverage and it may also increase the total
broadcast time.

		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/start-node-position-corner}
		\caption{The starting user (blue) placed in the corner can reach
		all the users inside the green

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{The area of reachability for the first message changes based on
	where the starting user is placed}\label{fig:startnodeexplain}
\end{figure}

Of course, the best scenario for both the coverage and the total broadcast time,
is the one where the starting user is in the center of the floorplan; the worst
is when the starting user is in the corner.

The Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis of this factor are placed in the
\code{analysis/StartNode/} folder.

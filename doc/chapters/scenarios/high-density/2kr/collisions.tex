\subsubsection{Total number of collisions}\label{subsubsec:hd2krcollisions}

For the total number of collisions we get a low unexplained variation
(\(0.67\%\)). The broadcast radius accounts for the \(66.27\%\) of the variation
and it is the dominant factor. Also the maximum number of copies and the maximum
relay delay have an impact on this index of the \(15.76\%\) and the \(4.64\%\)
respectively. The combination of the broadcast radius and the maximum number of
copies accounts for the \(9.01\%\) of the variation.

From the performance plot shown in \figref{subfig:hdperfcollisionsR} we can see
that reducing the broadcast radius we can obtain much lower values for the
number of collisions: less than 1000 with \(R\!=\!10m\) and always above 1500
and up to over 5500 with \(R\!=\!20m\). In \figref{subfig:hdperfcollisionsm} we
show that a lower maximum number of copies means a lower number of collisions:
with lower \(m\) we have less transmissions, especially in more crowded areas of
the floorplan where there are more users that relay their message to others.
Also the maximum relay delay has an impact on the number of collisions, as shown
in \figref{subfig:hdperfcollisionsD}. This happens because, with a larger
\(\max(\delta)\), different users relay their message in different slots more
often.

Probably we do not want to reduce the broadcast radius just to reduce the total
number of collisions. This performance index is in fact usually less important
than the others: if we have ``good'' results for the coverage, the broadcast
time and the energy efficiency of the network, even an high number of collisions
would be probably acceptable. So we should probably evaluate to increase the
maximum relay delay or reduce the maximum number of copies to reduce the number
of collisions: this should indirectly affect the energy efficiency by reducing
the total number of messages sent, especially if we decrease the
\code{maxCopies} parameter.

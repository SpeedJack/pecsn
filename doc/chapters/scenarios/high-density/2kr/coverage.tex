\subsubsection{Percentage of covered users}\label{subsubsec:hd2krcoverage}

As we can see from the table (see the Jupyter notebook), the lowest value for
the percentage of covered users is \(0.992883\!=\!99.2883\%\) found in two
experiments, meaning that there are two experiments where 1116 users out of
1124 (not counting the first one) have been reached (only 8 nodes have not heard
the message), while every other experiments gave higher results for the
coverage. The lowest mean of every repetitions is even higher:
\(0.997954\!=\!99.7954\%\). The coverage reaches its maximum value (\(100\%\))
in \(\frac{125}{160}\!=\!78.125\%\) of all the experiments.

Given these results, we can say that there is no need to analyze the percentage
of covered users in this scenario since it is almost always perfect (or nearly
perfect) and there is nothing to optimize. In any case, from common sense we can
derive that the most important factor to increase the coverage should be the
broadcast radius: higher radius allows each user to reach more users of the
network.

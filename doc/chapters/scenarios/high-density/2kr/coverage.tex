\subsubsection{Percentage of covered users}\label{subsubsec:hd2krcoverage}

As we can see from the table (see the Jupyter notebook), the lowest value for
the percentage of covered users is \(0.997331\!=\!99.7331\%\) found in four
experiments, meaning that there are four experiments where 1121 users out of
1124 (not counting the first one) have been reached (only 3 nodes have not heard
the message), while every other experiments gave higher results for the
coverage. The lowest mean of every repetitions is even higher:
\(0.9992\!=\!99.92\%\). The coverage reaches its maximum value (\(100\%\)) in
\(\frac{127}{160}\!=\!79.375\%\) of all the experiments.

Given these results, we can say that there is no need to analyze the percentage
of covered users in this scenario since it is almost always perfect (or nearly
perfect) and there is nothing to optimize. In any case, from the performance
plots at the end of the notebook, we can clearly see that, generally, in order
to have an higher chance of hitting the maximum coverage, the best we can do is
to increase the broadcast radius (\(R\)).

\subsection{2\texorpdfstring{\textsuperscript{k}}{k}r analysis}\label{subsec:ld2kr}

Analysis performed with \(k\!=\!4\) and \(r\!=\!10\), for a total of \(2^4 \cdot
10 \!=\!160\) experiments. The performance indexes evaluated are the one defined
in \secref{sec:indexes}. When we talk about the total number of messages sent
remember that we are analyzing the \emph{energy efficiency} (\(\mathit{Eff}\))
of the network.

The simulation configuration for this analysis, named ``LowDensity2kr'' can be
found in the \code{simulations.ini} file. The simulations have been run using
our \code{simulate.sh} script with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./simulate.sh -s LowDensity -c LowDensity2kr
\end{verbatim}

First, we have verified that the range of values for the \code{maxCopies}
parameter (2--6) was fine. The analysis can be found in \code{histograms.ipynb}.
Here, we just check that with \(m\!=\!2\) and \(m\!=\!6\) we get that a lot of
users decide to not relay the message in the first case and only a small bunch
of users decide to not relay the message in the second case.

Then, the 2\textsuperscript{k}r analysis can be found in \code{2kr.ipynb}. We
will verify the assumptions of normality, independence and finite variance for
the residuals in \secref{subsec:ldassumptions}. Here we will discuss the
results.

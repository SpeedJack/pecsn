\subsubsection{Finite variance}\label{ldassumptionsvariance}

As in the case of high density, the scatter plots for the variance of the
residuals of the total number of collisions and the total number of messages
sent don't show trends, it is only higher in the right of the plot for the
number of messages, but with residuals one order of magnitude less than the
predicted response. So we can conclude that the assumption of finite variance
is still valid.

As for the high density, to verify the assumption for the residuals of the 99th
percentile of the total broadcast time we need to perform a logarithmic
transformation of the predicted variable. The result is shown in
\figref{fig:ldtimevariance}.

\subsubsection{Normality}\label{subsubsec:ldassumptionsnormality}

In this case, we get better results for normality compared to those obtained in
the high density scenario: also the QQ-plot for the total number of messages
sent looks more linear with \(R^2\!=\!0.9322\).

Also in this case normality is not verified for the percentage of covered users.
Since we do not study this index, we do not need to get it verified.

\subsubsection{Percentage of covered users}\label{subsubsec:ld2krcoverage}

As in the case of the high density scenario, the percentage of covered users
almost always reaches its maximum value. The lowest value for the coverage is
\(99.1994\%\).

Given these results, we can say that there is no need to analyze the percentage
of covered users in this scenario since it is almost always perfect (or nearly
perfect) and there is nothing to optimize. In any case, from the performance
plots at the end of the notebook, we can clearly see that, generally, the
coverage increases with the broadcast radius (\(R\)), the maximum number of
copies (\(m\)) and the maximum relay delay (\(D\)).

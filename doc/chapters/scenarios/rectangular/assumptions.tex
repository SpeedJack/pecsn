\subsection{Testing the assumptions}\label{subsec:rectassumptions}

The assumptions of normality and finite variance must be verified for the
residuals of the observations. As in the other two scenarios, independency is
assumed by the way we have conducted the experiments (anyway, no trend is
visible in the scatter plots). The complete analysis can be found in
\code{2kr-assumptions-tests.ipynb}.

\subsubsection{Percentage of covered users}\label{subsubsec:rect2krcoverage}

As in the case of other scenarios, the percentage of covered users almost always
reaches its maximum value. The lowest value for is \(99.6664\%\). So, we will
not analyze this index. In any case, from the performance plots at the end of
the notebook, we can clearly see that, generally, the coverage increases with
the broadcast radius (\(R\)), the maximum number of copies (\(m\)) and the
maximum relay delay (\(D\)).

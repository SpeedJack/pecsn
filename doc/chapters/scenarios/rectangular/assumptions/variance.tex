\subsubsection{Finite variance}\label{rectassumptionsvariance}

As in the previous two cases, the scatter plots for the variance of the
residuals of the total number of collisions and the total number of messages
sent show trends. Also in this case the order of magnitude of the residual is
lower than the one of the average predicted response, so we can conclude that
the assumption of finite variance is still valid.

\ldots

So, in order to meet the requirement of finite variance for the residuals of the
total broadcast time, a transformed model is needed: \(y' = \ln(y)\).

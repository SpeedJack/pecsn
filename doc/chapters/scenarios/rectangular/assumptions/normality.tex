\subsubsection{Normality}\label{subsubsec:rectassumptionsnormality}

In this case, we get worse results for normality compared to those obtained in
the other scenarios, with generally lower \(R^2\) and few outliers in collisions
and in messages, but we can say anyway that the normality assumption is
verified, except to the covered users, but since we do not study this index, we
do not need to get it verified.

\section{Broadcast time}\label{sec:startnodetime}

Files \code{\{low,high\}-density-time.ipynb} contain the analysis for the
broadcast time needed to reach the 98th percentile of the coverage. The analysis
has been done fixing all the factors (also \(R\)) and by just varying the
position of the starting user. Configurations used are
``StartNodePositionLowDensityTime'' and ``StartNodePositionHighDensityTime''.

We get the results shown in \tableref{table:startnodetimeresults}.

	\caption{With the starting node at the border or the corner, we get an
	higher broadcast time compared to the case where the starting node is at
	the center}\label{table:startnodetimeresults}
\end{table}

As we can see, as the starting node moves near to the border/corner, we get
higher values for both the mean broadcast time. This can be explained by the
fact that, when the starting node is in the corner, the message need to traverse
the entire length of the floorplan in both its dimensions.  When, instead, it
starts from the center, since it is sent out radially by the user, the message
just needs to cover half of the side of the floorplan in each dimension. The
standard deviation is higher in the corner for the low density scenario but it
is lower in the high density scenario: a higher number of users leads to a lower
variance.

So, if possibile, also for the broadcast time, is better to set the starting
node near the center or, at least, avoid borders and corners of the floorplan.
